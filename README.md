# eReefs Static Website

## Setup

- Install Quarto
- run `quarto preview` and confirm the website displays as expected.

## Previewing

To see a preview of the site, run `quarto preview`, or alternatively render the markdown to html with `quarto render` then run `python3 -m http.server`

## Publishing

### Publishing manually

- Check out the branch you wish to deploy (ensure you have not checked out the `gh-pages` branch).
- run `quarto publish gh-pages`

This command will render the content, copy the output to the `gh-pages` branch, push that branch to GitHub.

### Publishing with GitHub Actions

Publishing with GitHub Actions set up accoring to [the quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages#github-action). However, the `_publish.yml` file was not generated by `quarto publish gh-pages`, which is not consistent with the documentation. The `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file has been set up to run the Quarto Publish on commits to the master branch (not the main branch as specified in the documentation).

To publish with GitHub actions, push your changes to the master branch.
