This page shows the strength and direction of ocean currents at different depths on the Great Barrier Reef based on the 4km eReefs Hydrodynamic model.


## Current at different depths

This map is useful for investigating the depth of various ocean currents. The strength of the current is represented by colour. The arrows represent the direction. In the hourly data a lot of the daily fluctuations are due to tidal currents. These tend to make the current direction swing back and forth as the tides flow and and out of a region.
