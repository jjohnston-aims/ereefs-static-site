    "text": "The eReefs model data is produced by CSIRO and published on the NCI THREDDS server (see section Download eReefs model data from NCI THREDDS server). For the visualisations on this portal, the AIMS eReefs system downloads, processes and aggregates the raw eReefs model data to provide multiple time steps (e.g. monthly, yearly) and to transform the data from a curvilinear to a rectilinear grid. While the curvilinear grid in the raw eReefs model data is better suited to the modelling and execution requirements, it can be cumbersome to process with typical data science tools. Therefore, all eReefs derived datasets generated by the AIMS eReefs system are regridded to a rectilinear grid.\nAll derived data produced by the AIMS eReefs system can be found on the AIMS eReefs THREDDS server. To download the data follow these steps:\n\nOpen the AIMS eReefs THREDDS server website and select the link Data derived from the eReefs model.\nOn the next page select the link to the required model\n\nGBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3P_Dhnd := eReefs BioGeoChemical model version 3.1 (4 km resolution) - source catchments using Pre-Industrial catchment conditions\nGBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3R_Dhnd := eReefs BioGeoChemical model version 3.1 (4 km resolution) - source catchments using Hindcast catchment conditions (anthropogenic loads reduced according to the percentage reductions of DIN, PN, PP and TSS specified in the Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan 2017-2022)\nGBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3b_Dhnd := eReefs BioGeoChemical model version 3.1 (4 km resolution) - source catchments using Baseline catchment conditions.\ngbr1_2.0 := eReefs Hydrodynamic model version 2.0 (1 km resolution)\ngbr4_v2 := Reefs Hydrodynamic model version 2.0 (4 km resolution)\n\nEach model has its derived output grouped into folders with the names indicating the time steps and aggregation in a file. For example a folder with the name \"daily-monthly\" contains \"monthly\" files with \"daily\" data while a folder with the name \"annual-annual\" contains \"annual\" files with \"annual\" data. Select the link to the folder of interest.\nIn the list of NetCDF files, select the one of interest. The file names describe the data they contain with the structure \"EREEFS_organisations_model_timestep-aggregation-date.nc\". For example the file \"EREEFS_AIMS-CSIRO_gbr4_v2_hydro_daily-monthly-2010-09.nc\" can be broken down into:\n\"AIMS-CSIRO\" := Reference to the organisations AIMS and CSIRO\n\"gbr4_v2_hydro\" := eReefs Hydrodynamic model version 2.0 (4 km resolution)\n\"daily\" := \"daily\" data\n\"monthly\" := one month of data\n\"2010-09\" := data for September 2010\nThe single file pages contain a section \"Access\".

This visualisation product is also available for the 1km eReefs Hydrodynamic model.\nThe combination of temperature, wind, salinity and current shows key hydrodynamic parameters of the Great Barrier Reef.\n\n\nThe temperature is primarily driven by the seasons and mixing of the water by wind and ocean currents. If the temperature rises too high during summer months then it can cause corals to bleach. This can be see during the summer months of 2016 and 2017.\n\n\n\nWind is a key driver of surface water currents, mixing and waves. In winter months the wind typically blows north west. These winds are known as the trade winds as they are a predictable seasonal pattern. In summer months the winds typically drop (except for cyclones) reducing the cooling and mixing of the water, resulting in significant surface temperatures rises during the day, creating a “heart-beat” pattern in the temperature in the video (see the Temperature panel in the March 2017 video as an example). The wind also drives the direction of the flood plumes. The north west blowing trade winds typically push any flood plumes back onto the coast and northwards. When the wind occasionally blows offshore then the plumes are pushed further out.\nThe path of cyclones can be seen in the wind variable. This shows the asymmetrical shape of the cyclone as it approaches the coast, due to the friction of the land slowing the winds on the southern side of the cyclone.\nNote: The winds in this model come from the BOM ACCESS meteorological product. This wind model does not accurately capture peak intensity of the cyclone or its exact path. It tends to underestimate the peak wind speeds. This is partly due to the model showing hourly average wind speed.\n\n\n\nSalinity is a measure of the salitiness of the water. Fresh water outflow from the rivers caused by flooding and rain events lowers the salinity (appearing as red in the maps). The low salinity is a good approximation for where flood plume waters might be. During flood plumes if the wind is blowing offshore then it will push the plume off the coast more toward the reefs. 2011 was a particularly wet year during the summer months causing extensive plumes to drift over reefal areas. (See Feb 2011 Burdekin region salinity panel for runoff from major flooding).\nNote: In flood plumes nutrient and sediment runoff lead to the formation of green plume water which has small suspended particles coated in algae that travel much further then is predicted by looking at just the lowering of the salinity. Current\nThe ocean currents are driven by the wind, tides, and temperature and salinity gradients. In the visualisations the strength of the current is represented by colour and the arrows represent the direction. In the hourly data (as shown in the videos) it is possible to see the tidal currents causing the direction of the current to flip back and forth. This tidal current increases the mixing of the water causing sediment in inshore areas to be stirred up. In the daily and monthly visualisations most of the fluctuations of the tidal currents are averaged out, allowing some of the large scale current flow patterns to be seen.\nMany marine organisms (such as Crown-of-Thorns Starfish and corals) are dispersed by ocean currents planktonic larvae that float from reef to reef.\n\n\n\n\nCyclones: Yasi (Feb 2011), Ita (April 2014), Nathan (March 2015), Debbi (March 2017),\nCoral bleaching from high temperature (March 2016, March 2017),\nFlood plumes with low salinity (Burdekin Jan 2011, Feb 2019).

The combination of temperature, wind, salinity and current shows key hydrodynamic parameters of the Great Barrier Reef.\n\n\nThe temperature is primarily driven by the seasons and mixing of the water by wind and ocean currents. If the temperature rises too high during summer months then it can cause corals to bleach. This can be see during the summer months of 2016 and 2017.\n\n\n\nWind is a key driver of surface water currents, mixing and waves. In winter months the wind typically blows north west. These winds are known as the trade winds as they are a predictable seasonal pattern. In summer months the winds typically drop (except for cyclones) reducing the cooling and mixing of the water, resulting in significant surface temperatures rises during the day, creating a “heart-beat” pattern in the temperature in the video (see the Temperature panel in the March 2017 video as an example). The wind also drives the direction of the flood plumes. The north west blowing trade winds typically push any flood plumes back onto the coast and northwards. When the wind occasionally blows offshore then the plumes are pushed further out.\nThe path of cyclones can be seen in the wind variable. This shows the asymmetrical shape of the cyclone as it approaches the coast, due to the friction of the land slowing the winds on the southern side of the cyclone.\n\n\n\nSalinity is a measure of the salitiness of the water. Fresh water outflow from the rivers caused by flooding and rain events lowers the salinity (appearing as red in the maps). The low salinity is a good approximation for where flood plume waters might be. During flood plumes if the wind is blowing offshore then it will push the plume off the coast more toward the reefs. 2011 was a particularly wet year during the summer months causing extensive plumes to drift over reefal areas. (See Feb 2011 Burdekin region salinity panel for runoff from major flooding).\nNote: In flood plumes nutrient and sediment runoff lead to the formation of green plume water which has small suspended particles coated in algae that travel much further then is predicted by looking at just the lowering of the salinity.\n\n\n\nThe ocean currents are driven by the wind, tides, and temperature and salinity gradients. In the visualisations the strength of the current is represented by colour and the arrows represent the direction. In the hourly data (as shown in the videos) it is possible to see the tidal currents causing the direction of the current to flip back and forth. This tidal current increases the mixing of the water causing sediment in inshore areas to be stirred up. In the daily and monthly visualisations most of the fluctuations of the tidal currents are averaged out, allowing some of the large scale current flow patterns to be seen.\nMany marine organisms (such as Crown-of-Thorns Starfish and corals) are dispersed by ocean currents planktonic larvae that float from reef to reef.\n\n\n\n\nCyclones: Nathan (March 2015), Debbi (March 2017),\nCoral bleaching from high temperature (March 2016, March 2017),\nFlood plumes with low salinity (Feb 2019)\nStrong East Australian Current (Nov 2015, monthly average current)\n\n\n\n\nThe videos/images on this page are based on the 4km eReefs Hydrodynamic model (v2.0) of the Great Barrier Reef. The raw data is available from the NCI THREDDS server (hourly) and the aggregate data from the AIMS eAtlas THREDDS server (daily, monthly, yearly, all). These map layers are also available for inspection as an interactive map.\n\n\n\nThe results are updated in near-real-time, however sometimes they can be behind real time up to 2 weeks. This happens due to delays in the model runs being held up for technical reasons or delays in source data that drive the model. This visualisation portal can sometimes also delay the products by up to 1 day. To check the latest available model data look at the date on the NCI THREDDS server.

For the ocean current data we use the IMOS - OceanCurrent - Gridded sea level anomaly - Near real time dataset and for the temperature the IMOS - SRS - SST - L3S - Single Sensor - 6 day - night time - Australia dataset. The 6 day period was chosen to reduce the chances of data gaps because of cloud coverage.\nThe comparison has some limitations that need to be considered. The IMOS satellite temperature data is created by layering the most recent readings over a 6-day period. This aggregation period helps to fill in areas that are covered by clouds in any one day. This does mean however that in some parts of the map the temperature can be up to 6 days old. The eReefs model will, however, always show a full map from a single day. Furthermore, the IMOS product estimates the temperature from nighttime readings while the eReefs temperature data is a 24-hour average (derived from hourly data). The eReefs ocean current data is also a 24-hour average. This reduces the tidal effects on the current vector, but doesn’t eliminate it, whereas the geostrophic velocities in the IMOS dataset are detided (see the metadata record for more information).\n\n\nThe videos/images on this page are based on the 4km eReefs Hydrodynamic model (v2.0) of the Great Barrier Reef.

    "section": "",
    "text": "OPeNDAP stands for \"Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol\" (see https://www.opendap.org/about) and can be used to access remote NetCDF files. The AIMS eReefs THREDDS server provides access via OPeNDAP for all NetCDF files produced by the AIMS eReefs system. In this tutorial we will use ArcMap to render the data, but you can also have a look at our tutorials How to plot AIMS eReefs data with R and How to plot AIMS eReefs data with Python for a more programatically approach. More clients can be found on the OPeNDAP clients website.\nShould I download the NetCDF files or use OPeNDAP to access the data?\nThe answer to this question depends mainly on the use-case. In general, the use of OPeNDAP is slower and more un-responsive but it is a good way to explore the data before downloading it (NetCDF files can be very large, sometimes multiple GB). When you exactly know which file(s) you need, it is recommended to download the file(s) (see How to open a NetCDF file with ArcMap and QGIS) as this will make working with the file(s) faster.\n\n\n\nOpen the AIMS eReefs THREDDS server website and select the link Data derived from the eReefs model.\nOn the next page select the link to the required model\n\nGBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3P_Dhnd := eReefs BioGeoChemical model version 3.1 (4 km resolution) - source catchments using Pre-Industrial catchment conditions\nGBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3R_Dhnd := eReefs BioGeoChemical model version 3.1 (4 km resolution) - source catchments using Hindcast catchment conditions (anthropogenic loads reduced according to the percentage reductions of DIN, PN, PP and TSS specified in the Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan 2017-2022)\nGBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3b_Dhnd := eReefs BioGeoChemical model version 3.1 (4 km resolution) - source catchments using Baseline catchment conditions.\ngbr1_2.0 := eReefs Hydrodynamic model version 2.0 (1 km resolution)\ngbr4_v2 := eReefs Hydrodynamic model version 2.0 (4 km resolution)\n\nEach model has its derived output grouped into folders with the names indicating the time steps and aggregation in a file. For example a folder with the name\"daily-monthly\" contains \"monthly\" files with \"daily\" data while a folder with the name \"annual-annual\" contains \"annual\" files with \"annual\" data. Select the link to the folder of interest.\nIn the list of NetCDF files, select the one of interest. The file names describe the data they contain with the structure \"EREEFS_organisations_model_timestep-aggregation-date.nc\". For example the file \"EREEFS_AIMS-CSIRO_gbr4_v2_hydro_daily-monthly-2010-09.nc\" can be broken down into:\n\"AIMS-CSIRO\" := Reference to the organisations AIMS and CSIRO\n\"gbr4_v2_hydro\" := eReefs Hydrodynamic model version 2.0 (4 km resolution)\n\"daily\" := \"daily\" data\n\"monthly\" := one month of data\n\"2010-09\" := data for September 2010\nOn the single file page in the section \"Access\" click the link \"OPENDAP\"\nOn the next page copy the value of the input field \"Data URL\".
