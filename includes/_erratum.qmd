## Erratum

From 28 Dec 2014 - 29 Dec 2014 and from 1 Dec - 10 Dec 2021, the forcing data
for the GBR1 eReefs model was incorrect due to a process failure while
extracting the relevant ACCESS data. This resulted in static tides and winds
during this period, leading to incorrect model outputs during Dec 2014 and
2021, with some carry over error into Jan 2022. This forcing error led to a
decrease in water mixing resulting in the temperature building up several
degrees hotter than it should and to the flood plumes from the Fitzroy and
Burnett moving in the wrong direction.

CSIRO are correcting this problem by re-running the model from Dec 2021 for
several months to replace this section of the data. This warning will be
updated when this change has been made.
